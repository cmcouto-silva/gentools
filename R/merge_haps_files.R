#' @title Merge Shapeit files (.haps/.sample)
#' @description Merge Shapeit files (.haps/.sample) to a single one. All files in the folder will be merged (if correspondents)!
#' @param haps_files Character. Path to the folder where files are alocated (.haps and correspondent .sample files)
#' @param output Character. Desired name for output WITHOUT extension. Default set to "merged".
#' @return Dataset without monomorphic alleles.
