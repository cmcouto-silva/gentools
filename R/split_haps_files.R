#' @title Split Shapeit files (.haps/.sample)
#' @description Split a single dataset (.haps/.sample) by chromossome into multiple files.
#' @param haps_file Character. File name (with or without .haps extension).
#' @param output_path Character. Desired folder to outputs. Default set to current folder.
#' @param out Character. Desired name to output files after "chrX", where "X" is the chromosome ID. Default set to none.
#' @return Multiple files from dataset splitted by chromosome unique IDs.
#' @examples

#' \dontrun{
#' dataset <- "merged.haps" # or just "merged"
#' split_haps_files(haps_file = dataset, "splitted_files/", out = "_phased")
#'
#' # Then, multiple files splitted by chromosomes will be created at the folder "splitted_files",
#' named "chrID_phased.EXT", where ID is the unique chromosome ID, and EXT is the correspoding extension (.haps/.sample)
